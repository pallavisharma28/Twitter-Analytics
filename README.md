# Applying Sentiment Analysis to Twitter Movie Reviews

#In this project an attempt has been made to classify the polarity of movie reviews posted on
#Twitter for the movie “Dunkirk” as positive and negative. For this purpose, reviews are first
#fetched from Twitter and cleaned to be useful for further analysis. Bayes’ classification is used to
#classify polarity of the reviews. Additionally, the reviews are also classified according to seven
#basic emotions. Later word cloud is generated to determine the most frequent terms in different
#categories of emotions. Accuracy of 80.07% and 84.53% was achieved for classifying positive
#and negative sentiments respectively for the reviews.
